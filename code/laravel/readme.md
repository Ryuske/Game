# Game - No Idea What It's Called Yet

## To Do
* Fix comments
* Write unit tests for player attacking & whatever other combat things don't have unit tests
* Add player heal & run
* Work on damage calculator so that 1 hit KOs aren't possible in the very beginning of the game -- oops!
* Make collections throw exception if trying to access an index that doesn't exist

## Stuff To Think About
* Probably should try and find a better way to test random events - rather than just running the same code 10 times
